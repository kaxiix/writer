Grade the essay using the following Band descriptors:
BAND 9:
Task Response: The prompt is appropriately addressed and explored in depth. A clear and fully developed position is presented which directly answers the question/s. Ideas are relevant, fully extended, and well supported. Any lapses in content or support are extremely rare.
Coherence & Cohesion: The message can be followed effortlessly. Cohesion is used in such a way that it very rarely attracts attention. Any lapses in coherence or cohesion are minimal. Paragraphing is skilfully managed.
Lexical Resource: Full flexibility and precise use are widely evident. A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately and appropriately with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features. Minor errors in spelling and word formation are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: A wide range of structures is used with full flexibility and control. Punctuation and grammar are used appropriately throughout. Minor errors are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.

BAND 8:
Task Response: The prompt is appropriately and sufficiently addressed. A clear and well-developed position is presented in response to the question/s. Ideas are relevant, well extended, and supported. There may be occasional omissions or lapses in content.
Coherence & Cohesion: The message can be followed with ease. Information and ideas are logically sequenced, and cohesion is well managed. Occasional lapses in coherence and cohesion may occur. Paragraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately.
Lexical Resource: A wide resource is fluently and flexibly used to convey precise meanings. There is skilful use of uncommon and/or idiomatic items when appropriate, despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation. Occasional errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur, but have minimal impact on communication.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: A wide range of structures is flexibly and accurately used. The majority of sentences are error-free, and punctuation is well managed. Occasional, non-systematic errors and inappropriacies occur, but have minimal impact on communication.

BAND 7:
Task Response: The main parts of the prompt are appropriately addressed. A clear and developed position is presented. Main ideas are extended and supported but there may be a tendency to overgeneralize or there may be a lack of focus and precision in supporting ideas/material.
Coherence & Cohesion: Information and ideas are logically organized, and there is a clear progression throughout the response. A range of cohesive devices including reference and substitution is used flexibly but with some inaccuracies or some over/under use. Paragraphing is generally used effectively to support overall coherence, and the sequencing of ideas within a paragraph is generally logical.
Lexical Resource: The resource is sufficient to allow some flexibility and precision. There is some ability to use less common and/or idiomatic items. An awareness of style and collocation is evident, though inappropriacies occur. There are only a few errors in spelling and/or word formation, and they do not detract from overall clarity.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: A variety of complex structures is used with some flexibility and accuracy. Grammar and punctuation are generally well controlled, and error-free sentences are frequent. A few errors in grammar may persist, but these do not impede communication.

BAND 6:
Task Response: The main parts of the prompt are addressed (though some may be more fully covered than others). An appropriate format is used. A position is presented that is directly relevant to the prompt, although the conclusions drawn may be unclear, unjustified, or repetitive. Main ideas are relevant, but some may be insufficiently developed or may lack clarity, while some supporting arguments and evidence may be less relevant or inadequate.
Coherence & Cohesion: Information and ideas are generally arranged coherently, and there is a clear overall progression. Cohesive devices are used to some good effect, but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical due to misuse, overuse, or omission. Paragraphing may not always be logical, and the central topic may not always be clear.
Lexical Resource: The resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task. The meaning is generally clear in spite of a restricted range or a lack of precision in word choice. Some errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur, but these do not impede communication.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: A mix of simple and complex sentence forms is used, but flexibility is limited. Examples of more complex structures are not marked by the same level of accuracy as in simple structures. Errors in grammar and punctuation occur, but rarely impede communication.

BAND 5:
Task Response: The main parts of the prompt are incompletely addressed. The format may be inappropriate in places. The writer expresses a position, but the development is not always clear. Some main ideas are put forward, but they are limited and are not sufficiently developed and/or there may be irrelevant detail.
Coherence & Cohesion: Organization is evident but is not wholly logical, and there may be a lack of overall progression. The relationship of ideas can be followed, but sentences are not fluently linked to each other. Cohesive devices may be overused or misused. Paragraphing may be inadequate or missing.
Lexical Resource: The resource is limited but minimally adequate for the task. Simple vocabulary may be used accurately, but the range does not permit much variation in expression. There may be frequent lapses in the appropriacy of word choice, and a lack of flexibility is apparent. Errors in spelling and/or word formation may be noticeable and may cause some difficulty for the reader.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: The range of structures is limited and repetitive. Complex sentences are attempted but tend to be faulty. Grammatical errors are frequent and may cause difficulty for the reader.

BAND 4:
Task Response: The prompt is tackled in a minimal way, or the answer is tangential, possibly due to some misunderstanding of the prompt. A position is discernible, but the reader has to read carefully to find it. Main ideas are difficult to identify and may lack relevance, clarity, and/or support.
Coherence & Cohesion: Information and ideas are evident but not arranged coherently, and there is no clear progression. Relationships between ideas can be unclear and/or inadequately marked. Basic cohesive devices may be inaccurate or repetitive. Paragraphing may be absent, and the central topic may not be clear.
Lexical Resource: The resource is limited and inadequate for or unrelated to the task. Vocabulary is basic and repetitive. Errors in spelling and/or word formation may impede meaning.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: A very limited range of structures is used. Subordinate clauses are rare, and simple sentences predominate. Grammatical errors are frequent and may impede meaning.

BAND 3:
Task Response: No part of the prompt is adequately addressed, or the prompt has been misunderstood. No relevant position can be identified. There are few ideas, and these may be irrelevant or insufficiently developed.
Coherence & Cohesion: There is no apparent logical organization. Ideas are discernible but difficult to relate to each other. Cohesive devices are minimal and may not indicate logical relationships. Paragraphing may be unhelpful or absent.
Lexical Resource: The resource is inadequate, with possible over-dependence on memorized phrases. Errors in spelling and word formation predominate and impede meaning.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: Sentence forms are attempted, but errors predominate. Grammar and punctuation errors prevent most meaning from coming through.

BAND 2:
Task Response: The content is barely related to the prompt. No position can be identified. There may be glimpses of one or two ideas without development.
Coherence & Cohesion: There is little evidence of control of organizational features.
Lexical Resource: The resource is extremely limited with few recognizable strings, apart from memorized phrases. Errors predominate and impede meaning.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: There is little or no evidence of sentence forms.

BAND 1:
Task Response: Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. The content is wholly unrelated to the prompt.
Coherence & Cohesion: Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. No logical organization is evident.
Lexical Resource: Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. No resource is apparent.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at Band 1. No rateable language is evident.

BAND 0:
Task Response: The student did not attend or attempt the question in any way, used a language other than English throughout, or the answer is wholly memorized.
Coherence & Cohesion: Not applicable.
Lexical Resource: Not applicable.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: Not applicable.
